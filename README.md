Ansible Playbooks with [Cumulus Networks NCLU Module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/nclu_module.html)

Prior to the Cumulus Networks NCLU Module for Ansible I wrote this Knowledge Base article on backup and restoring configs on Cumulus Linux here: [https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/209620358-Ansible-Backing-up-Existing-Configurations](https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/209620358-Ansible-Backing-up-Existing-Configurations).  This way will still work but for those who want to use the NCLU module and net command soley and not keep track of which files they are touching this gives an alternate method.
